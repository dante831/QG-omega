# QG-omega inversion

This repository accompanies the paper Li and O'Gorman, 2019, "Response of Vertical Velocities in Extratropical Precipitation Extremes to Climate Change". It includes all data used to plot figures in the main paper, and some of the figures in the supporting information. For a copy of the paper, please see this [link](https://pog.mit.edu/src/li_omega_equation_precipitation_extremes_2019.pdf), and the supporting information can be seen at this [link](https://pog.mit.edu/src/li_omega_equation_precipitation_extremes_supp_2019.pdf). 

## Prerequisites

You will need Matlab version 2016b to run the code

## The main_plot routine

For the full analysis, open a matlab session, and directly run main_plot.m in the QG-omega folder: 
```
main_plot
```

## Inverting QG-omega equation using an example event

## Plotting figures



### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
